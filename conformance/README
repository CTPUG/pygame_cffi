This is intended to test conformance between pygame and pygame_cffi

Status
======

Currently, it exercises parts the pygame.draw and pygame.transform modules

NOTE: On OSX (or possibly some other thing that's different), loading a file
      with transparent pixels returns slightly different RGB values for those
      pixels. Currently the `scale` test is affected by this.

Usage
=====

Run gen_conformance.py using pygame to create a set of test images
Run test_conformance.py using pygame_cffi to run the test and generate
a set of test and difference images for the cases which differ

Both options take the following command line options:
  --verbose - Verbose output about the operation of the runner
  --list-tests - Lists the tests registered with the runner
  --run-tests=test1,test2 - Restrict the tests run to just the listed test
                            functions. This doesn't change the depths the
                            tests are run against.

Adding a test
=============

Write a function that takes a pygame surface as it's sole parameter and draws
the neccesary details on the surface.

The function should be decorated with the ```conformance_test_case``` decorator,
optionally specifiying which depths the test should be run at. By default,
the test is run with 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit surfaces.

Ensure the file with the function is imported by __init__.py, so the
test will be correctly registered with the runners.

Generated files
===============

results/gen_<depth>_<test>.png  - The generated conformance images
results/test_<depth>_<test>.png - The corresponding test image
results/diff_<depth>_<test>.png - The difference image. This is only
                                  created if the images differ
