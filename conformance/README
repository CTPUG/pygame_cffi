This is intended to test conformance between pygame and pygame_cffi

Status
======

Currently, it exercises parts the pygame.draw and pygame.transform modules

NOTE: On OSX (or possibly some other thing that's different), loading a file
      with transparent pixels returns slightly different RGB values for those
      pixels. Currently the `scale` test is affected by this.

Usage
=====

Run gen_conformance.py using pygame to create a set of test images
Run test_conformance.py using pygame_cffi to run the test and generate
a set of test and difference images for the cases which differ


Adding a test
=============

Write a function that takes a pygame surface as it's sole parameter and draws
the neccesary details on the surface.

The function should be decorated with the ```conformance_test_case``` decorator,
specifying the test name used to save the images produced by the test case,
optionally specifiying which depths the test should be run at. By default,
the test is run with 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit surfaces.

Import this function in tests/__init__.py and add a entry for it to the
conformances_tests list.


Generated files
===============

results/gen_<depth>_<test>.png  - The generated conformance images
results/test_<depth>_<test>.png - The corresponding test image
results/diff_<depth>_<test>.png - The difference image. This is only
                                  created if the images differ
